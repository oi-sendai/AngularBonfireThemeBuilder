#Angular Bonfire Theme Creator

To get started run the following command in the route folder of your CodeIgnitor Bonfire project

```
bash ./create-theme.sh
```

The following dependancies are required
-npm
-bower
-gulp

You might also need to run 

```
npm install -g gulp bower sass
sudo !!
```

The program will ask you for the name of your theme and first module, build out the required folder structure.

All you need to do is then include in your header.php file
```
<link href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>/css/angular-bonfire.css">
```

And in footer.php
```
<script src="<?php echo js_path(); ?>angular-bonfire.js"></script>
```

In /application/config/application.php:

```
$config['template.default_theme'] = 'yourtheme/';
```


##Todo
-Add native Bonfire: Modernizer support
-Automatically update /application/config/application.php
